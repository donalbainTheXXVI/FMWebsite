                <p>Personally, I give the movie an <span class="bold">8/10</span>. It's paced well and knows where to stop itself at the end of events, and it knows where to start another intense situation again. Here is a <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_dirt_2019">link</a> to another review of the movie, done by Rotten Tomatoes. It is also good to note that the movie is rated R for mature.</p>
